![a card sort on a table](./card-sort-table.jpg)

My first act of UX for Richland Library was an attempt to make sense of their main navigation.

## Selecting The Cards
I collected the most trafficed sections of the site as well as the biggest sign posts from the existing main menus to come up with a short list of 30 items. That number, 30, happens to be the limit on how many cards can be put into a card sort when using [Optimal Workshop](http://optimalworkshop.com) on a free account, but it also happens to be the right number for a session that most people feel comfortable with (somewhere between 20 and 40 and no more than 120).

## Responses
The responses converged on 2 major categories and a few minor categories:

GENERAL RESOURCES (i.e. The Catalog)
![general resources](./general-resources.png)

LIBRARY INFORMATION (i.e. Everything Else)
![library information](./library-information.png)

get involved (i.e. volunteering/working at the library)
![get involved](./get-involved.png)
![business and careers](./business-and-careers.png)
![events](./events.png)

There were common associations that disagree with the above categories:

- 50% Library Locations & construction updates
- 50% Sign up for a library card & Request an obituary
- 50% Ask a librarian & Request an obituary
- 46% Career and Job Resources & Social Worker Assistance
- 40% Hours of Operation & Construction updates
- 38% Request a Purchase & Finding Books

## Impact
This card sort would pave the way for a much larger one, but since card sorts start to break down past 30 cards, some creative solutions were necessary.
