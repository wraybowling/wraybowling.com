## Embrace Failure, An Introduction
At some point in 2008, I became enamored with a few certain bizarre videos on YouTube. This was not just funny cat videos anymore, these were complex feats of reinventing what entertainment in the video format could be. Shows like Food Party, Let's Paint TV, and perhaps even all the "Sweded" movies. That thing in the air was best held up by Mr. Let's Paint's mantra: Embrace Failure. Lots of artists were interested in doing things for themselves, and not just doing it for fun anymore, but actually trying their hand at productions, very large in scope, but with zero regard for any previous methods established before them. The result is raw, wonky, and extremely fast. In their haste, the human experience of failing at almost every turn bleeds into the final product. And I mean there's blood everywhere.

The trouble with any organization system is that it tends to fail when viewed through any other organization system. Standardization has forced many a person into being more confused than they'd like to be. The most common of solutions people tend to reach for is to use a tool like Microsoft Excel. But you'd be fooling yourself if you go down this pathway thinking that it will work well for other people.

This series of essays, much in the spirit of Breaking Smart, is an exploration of methods that embraces the mess that is the real world, and how we can serve up that content without boxing users in to boundaries that makes absolutely no sense to them. Beware of confirmation bias!!
