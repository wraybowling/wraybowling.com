JoyStation is a standalone kiosk designed to collect arbitrary survey data in low foot trafficked areas at a high resolution.

# Process
## 0.x
Rapid prototyping and iteration drove all of JoyStation's design decisions. The earliest version was nothing more than four crudely drawn faces. This web page was loaded on a tablet, put in a wobbly kiosk stand, and set out for customers to toy with until the battery ran out.

## 1.x
The most obvious problems with v0 were

2. The graphics were crudely drawn
