# Wray Bowling

My name is Wray. The W is silent. I've been doing web development for <since time="1 Aug 2000 2:30:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)"/>. This is my new web site where I divulge deeply on my methods, processes, projects, and the people who have helped me make it all happen.

Writing and development is done in the open using Github, Netlify, Vuepress, & Markdown. [You can contribute by proof-reading future content.](https://github.com/wraybowling/wraybowling.com/pulls)
