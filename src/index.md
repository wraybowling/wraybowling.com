Well, here we are. Hey! You're a user. My name is Wray. The W is silent. I am a musician, digital artist, interactive designer, and web developer of the past <since time="1 Aug 2000 2:30:00 GMT-0400 (EDT)"/>. This is a basic landing page that links to other places where I've better established myself.

## Web Development & Open Source

I'm an advocate for open source methods, even in closed sourced settings.

- I use [BitBucket.com/rgbk](https://bitbucket.org/rgbk/) mainly for private repositories built between 2010-2013
  - [Richland Library Events Calendar Prototype](https://bitbucket.org/rgbk/rcpl-events) built with MeteorJS using and a rapid prototyping method.
- [GitHub.com/wraybowling](https://github.com/wraybowling/) is where most of my repositories live now. Some highlights below:
  - [Richland Library Wayfinding Prototype](https://github.com/wraybowling/wayfinding) is meant to run on touchscreen kiosks, directing customers to events. Implemented as a rapid prototype in Vue.js and ArcGIS to provide 3D models inside Google Maps.
  - [MIDImp](https://github.com/wraybowling/MIDImp) is a headless script to send MIDI over OSC to the PlayStation 4/5.
  - [Shaper-taper](https://github.com/wraybowling/shaper-taper) is an interactive webapp for printing fudicial markers compatible with Shaper Origin.
  - [Blender-Shaper](https://github.com/wraybowling/Blender-Shaper) is a Blender add-on that converts Blender curves to real world sized SVGs.
  - [Geiger.js](https://github.com/wraybowling/Geiger.js) clicks when your web app's animation drops a frame. Uses Web Audio API synthesis.
- You can additionally find many of my front-end sketches on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/wraybowling). Since much of my work has been closed source or protected under NDA, these quick sketches demonstrate how I approached problem solving over the years.
  - [Synced Oscilloscope](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/JGpRVo) combines the Web Audio API with SVG rendering, written in vanilla JS.
  - [Spritz Clone +](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/BjxNQd) mimics the behavior of the Spritz speedreading product with more features than the original
  - [Tweet Summary Visualization](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/zrjGxe) is a rich text editor bespoke to writing content for two different limited text formats simultaneously. It also visualizes incomplete sentences.
  - [Instant Feedback for Active Links](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/zrXExy) prototypes an animated "barber pole" underline that can be applied to plain text links that instantiate asynchronous calls with potentially long wait times.
  - [Jaro Winkler Search](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/eJMpwG) demos an implementation of the JWS on a set of FAQs from [buildingyourlibrary.com](https://buildingyourlibrary.com)
  - [Draft Content Overlay](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/yPjaWj) proposes a way of overlaying the word "draft" for unfinished sections of content without affecting screenshots.
  - [Various](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/OmdPKV) [Spinners](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/ExOogbE) made with SVG+CSS

  - [Blurry Image As Background](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/jMbQpJ) is a proof of concept for re-using a source image to color the region behind it.
  - [Text Editor with SMOG](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/yJMZmK) runs a realtime evaluation of the text entered against the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) algorithm, to determine the required reading level.
  - [Text Editor with ARI](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/jqewBJ) similarly runs a reading level evalutation of the text entered in realtime, but using the Automated Readability Index.
  - [Sassless Flex Columns](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/BKqabE) is a demo of my CSS boilerplate Sassless, showing how to create a fully responsive layout that was compatible with IE.
  - [SVG Arc Modes](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/WrMoNK) explains the different modes with animation
  - [Printable Calendar](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/YwNMMP) makes use of CSS media query and overflow rules to perfectly render events across multiple pages. Techniques used here were later brought to Shaper-Taper
  - [Various](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/yeKvvw) [Date-Range](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/EPqJGW) [Pickers](https://codepen.io/wraybowling/pen/obPzKy) throughout time.

## Contact Me

I am, as of October 2023, open to opportunities that are the right fit. My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wraybowling/) is more up to date and thorough than any resume I've ever maintained manually, but [here's an HTML page of my CV anyway](/cv.md).
