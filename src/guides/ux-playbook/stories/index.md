## 3.1 Job Stories

One can imagine a job story like a montage scene of a movie that follows a process.
a package leaves one person's desk ... and arrives on another
a can is recycled ... and becomes a new can
a struggling boxer ... wins the heavyweight championship
What these examples—and all job stories—have in common is that a lot happens between the start and the end goal. The package may change hands between lots of people, equipment, organizations, and modes of transportation. The can, after being sorted, washed, crushed, etc may be sold as scrap multiple times involving market pricing, salespeople, truck drivers, energy cost, purity, and so on. The boxer may meet a shy woman named Adrian which motives him to train harder than he thought possible to the tune of "Gonna Fly Now" running up the 72 stone steps leading to the entrance of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The point here is that completing a job means following the details, the nuances, the people, places, and tools involved. Most projects tend to have a handful of job stories, each which include plenty of user stories, often with overlap.
