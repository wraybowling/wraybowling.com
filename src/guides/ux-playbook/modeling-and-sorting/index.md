Sorting can be performed in two directions, edges-to-center (IN), and center-to-edges (OUT).

Data Modeling (OUT)
Data Modeling is often the most productive place to start. It involves mapping out how things are stored, how concepts are currently grouped together, even if it's not a 1-to-1 representation of how content is organized presently. The point of data modeling is to distill information into a more pure form. Do not leave out details, but remove duplicates as they arise. You are, in fact, your best first user to test. You are not, however, the best last user to test. So once the data models are complete, move on to iterative methods.

Card Sorting (IN)
There are plenty of resources online that outline how to conduct a card sort
The most successful card sorts I've conducted come from "A Modified Delphi Approach to a New Card Sorting Methodology"
Don't bother resetting the test. Put the blame of imperfection on an anonymous third party, important because it takes away a lot of the "name badge" effect. Customers no longer are so worried about pleasing the tester, and are more willing collaborate to "fix" what's "wrong"

Memory Mutations (THRU)
Present a process then ask the user to teach the process back to another person. Repeat until the process is simplified.

Tree Sorting (OUT)
Later in the project, when job stories have been formed, it's useful to use tree sorting as a method of validation.
