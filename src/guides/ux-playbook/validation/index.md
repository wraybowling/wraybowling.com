# 4. Validation

## Tree Sorting

Tree Sorting, also called Reverse Card Sorting, is a method that has not been used much here because there are not many tools we can use besides Optimal Workshop's Treejack.

## User Interviews

The most powerful validation method by far, but also hard to quantify results from. Essentially what you're looking for in a usability interview is if the user is successful in completing their tasks. The amount of friction they experience can be the result of many different factors all of which may not be under your control. 

There are many different ways to go about an interview, but the most effective ones involve a

> • Web browser should be open to Google or some other “neutral” page
> Hi, ___________. My name is ___________, and I’m going to be walking you through this session today.
> Before we begin, I have some information for you, and I’m going to read it to make sure that I cover everything.
> You probably already have a good idea of why we asked you here, but let me go over it again briefly. We’re asking people to try using a Web site that we’re working on so we can see whether or not it works as intended. The session should take about a half hour.
> The first thing I want to make clear right away is that we’re testing the site, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. In fact, this is probably the one place today where you don’t have to worry about making mistakes. 
> As you use the site, I’m going to ask you as much as possible to try to think out loud: to say what you’re looking at, what you’re trying to do, and what you’re thinking. This will be a big help to us.
> Also, please don’t worry that you’re going to hurt our feelings. We’re doing this to improve the site, so we need to hear your honest reactions. 
> Do you have any questions so far?
> OK. Before we look at the site, I’d like to ask you just a few quick questions. 
> First, what’s your occupation? What do you do all day? (Person description)
> Now, roughly how many hours a week altogether—just a ballpark estimate— would you say you spend using the Internet, including Web browsing and email, at work and at home? (Person description)
> And what’s the split between email and browsing—a rough percentage? (Person description)
> What kinds of sites are you looking at when you browse the Web? (Browser at home)
> Do you have any favorite Web sites? (Browser at home)
> Do you attend library events? (circle answer)
> OK, great. We’re done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.
> 
> • Click on the bookmark for the site’s Home page.
> First, I’m going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you make of it: what strikes you about it, whose site you think it is, what you can do here, and what it’s for. Just look around and do a little narrative.
> You can scroll if you want to, but don’t click on anything yet.
> 
> • Allow this to continue for three or four minutes, at most.
> Thanks. Now I’m going to ask you to try doing some specific tasks. I’m going to read each one out loud and give you a printed copy.
> I’m also going to ask you to do these tasks without using Search. We’ll learn a lot more about how well the site works that way.
> And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud as you go along.
