Discovering what users want is a strange task. Who's the user anyway? Often, you are a user just as much as anyone else, and often you'll feel like you already have solutions in mind. The UX Discovery Process outlined here was designed not to supress those ideas, but to make sure that they are supplemented well with customer input. Likewise User Experience Design is often overly focused on customers, but this guide is designed to ensure that content creators are tailored to just as much as content consumers.

"A list of frequently asked questions is a list of things wrong with your web site."

1.1 Collect Your Content
Peruse through all of the content that is being read, filtered, mutated, edited, managed, or distributed. The goal of this task is to find redundancies in the information architecture. The product is a tree structure that will later be compared to your revised information architecture.

Do not allow content that is pre-grouped to stay together except by nesting. For example "Memorial & Tribute Gifts" should be split into "Memorial Gifts" and "Tribute Gifts." You should always assume that any previous decision to group things together might've been done unintuitively. If they are in fact the same thing, perhaps you'll spark a discussion about cementing just one word to label these things. If they are in fact different, then they can be separated for ease of browsing.


1.2 Pick the Leaves from The Tree
All of your content is currently in an existing hierarchy that is defined largely by its labels. Take those labels away, and what you end up with is just the content itself without organization. This is essential for unbiased reorganization.

1.3 Remove Duplicates
It is perfectly okay to start removing things that are redundant. If you are unsure if two things are the same, leave them aside for testing. The goal is to distill the information available to users so that there are no more duplicates.

1.4 Remove Patterns
You will also have to ensure that you erase artifacts from the previous hierarchy that live inside of the content. These can be hard to recognize, but it is just as important for unbiased reorganization. Two items that were previously collected together are likely worded in identical fashion to make the content easier to put together. By changing the wording of all content that was previously grouped together, you give testers less reason to group that content together based solely on the wording.

Give-away patterns to watch out for:
special names for the kind of content
brand names
