## I'm Wray
I like making things that are interactive, respond instantaneously, and communicate ideas elegantly. I’m big on small files that do a lot, banishing unnecessary stateful UX, documentation as I go, and recyclable object-oriented structures. When I’m not programming for work, I do it for fun, and when I’m not designing things for work I do it for fun. I’m seeking a position that is looking for someone who has a passion for bridging the gap or even managing it.

## This is for you
This web site and its contents are being built completely in the open on Github. Comments and pull requests are welcome. If you're interested in building a site of your own the same way, there are a number of blog posts on that very subject. Similarly, this site is sort of a meta-site that explains web technologies by embodying those technologies. The code is written to be be as human friendly as possible.



Thanks for stopping by,
Wray Bowling
